# Arma 3 Survival
Survival started as a project to simply fix some bugs with [Dynamic Bulwarks](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1402462003). It, however, morphed into a far larger endeavor to do not only a complete rewrite but to upgrade many of the user-facing systems within it.

This project is still regularly looked at for improvements even if it appears inactive, this is simply due to more pressing matters at that time and/or temporary fatigue with the project. Forking is encouraged.
